                <h2>Flair of Peace</h2>
                <p>
                    Life has always got a setback which ignites our inner core to unleash the beast within. We put in our blood, sweat, and brains altogether as a part of our valiant efforts to conquer our penultimate triumph and the ultimate glory. The soul craves for a soothing melody, the intellect for tranquility, and the humour often goes for a toss. Then comes the desired silence in the meadows of the mind. This enables us to think soundly within the mind box. In the meantime, nature begins to play the trump card of being nice to us, as the wounds within the walls of the heart need to be nursed. Agony in the misery of a sedentary lifestyle comes to it's fateful extremity. There's solitude which helps us reach altitudes in the mystical dimension. Life is never meant to be fair, as it always intends to give us the flair of peace. This flair of peace gives us the elixir of happiness.

                <h2>Dooming Reality</h2>
                <p>
                    A charming vagabond by mind, stuck in a tornado of derogatory philosophy, is in pursuit of ultimate peace. Is death the doorway to nirvana? Is there an afterlife? Several questions popped up unanswered within the mind box. Thoughts appeared to be assertive, opinions became manipulative, and emotions turned out to be imperative to the heart. The very physical existence is at the brink of collapse, all thanks to the billions of permutations and combinations of wild provocations. People delve within your heart until there's rock left. An impending predicament becomes a dooming reality.

                <h2>Soul</h2>
                <p>
                    In this journey of mine, I would say there were times where my heart bled profusely. The soul repented for the mistakes of the mind. Few specific people made me realise they can overpower my thoughts, not because of their prowess, but due to my weakness. I wouldn't call it weakness, but an emotional attachment. Emotion makes you deny logic. It never lets you see thoroughly, rather, I would say it gives a chance to view the world through the mirror of the soul. Give way to depression, rather than suffer in regression.
